# Get_Cafe_Name_and_Coffee_Price
I used Flask and SQLAlchemy to build a REST API. Data of all the cafes in a particular city was collected and the ones that were suitable for remote-work were figured out. It can also be used to search for a particular cafe, price of coffee and new cafes can be added to the database.
